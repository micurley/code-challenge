## Code Challenge

### Description

This repo contains the ReactJS codebase in response to a potential employer's code challenge

---

### Goal

Create a basic react app that allows a user to:

* search for Github users
* display Github user's publicly available info
* display Github user's publicly available repositories
* initiate a new search

---

### Approach

The key interaction is the user initialed search so I will make that the pages priority. Once engaged the user should be able to initial a search of Github users, narrowing down the available options once the search exceeds a reasonable base.

Once a target Github user is selected, let the app user know the repositories are being requested and display once they are received.

Restart the process when the site user initiates a new search
